# For this project, you will create a collection database using Python dictionaries. You will choose a category of items to store and organize them in a dictionary format. The program should allow the user to add, update, remove, and display items from the collection. Your dictionary should contain at least ten items, with each item having its own dictionary (keys and values/properties). Make sure this code uses the same type of code that is already in the main.py file
# I used AI to make some of the code so that it will meet the requirements of the assignment.
# I used my contact book code to show how the terminal should be used and the code now seems to work but I need check and make sure it meets all of the requirements.
